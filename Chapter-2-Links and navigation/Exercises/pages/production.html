        <p><i>How I Met Your Mother</i> was inspired by Carter Bays and Craig Thomas' idea to "write about our 
            friends and the stupid stuff we did in New York", where they previously worked as writers for 
            <b>Late Show with David Letterman</b>, among others. The two drew from their friendship in 
            creating the characters. Ted is based loosely on Bays, and Marshall and Lily are based loosely 
            on Thomas and his wife. Thomas' wife Rebecca was initially reluctant to have a character based on 
            her but agreed if they could get <b>Alyson Hannigan</b> to play her. Hannigan was looking to do more 
            comedy work and was available. <b>Josh Radnor</b> and <b>Jason Segel</b>, who were cast as Ted and 
            Marshall, respectively, were not well known, although Segel had been a cast member on the short-lived 
            <b>Freaks and Geeks</b> and a recurring guest star on <b>Judd Apatow's</b> follow-up show, <b>Undeclared</b>. 
            The role of Barney was initially envisioned as a "<b>John Belushi-type character</b>" before <b>Neil Patrick 
            Harris</b> won the role after being invited to an audition by the show's casting director Megan Branman.
            <b>Pamela Fryman</b> invited <b>Bob Saget</b> to be the voiceover narrator, Future Ted, explaining to him 
            that the show would be like <b>The Wonder Years</b> but "kind of into the future". Saget either went to the 
            television studio and recorded the narration while watching the episode, or did so separately and rerecorded 
            with the episode if necessary. He normally did not attend <b>table readings</b> but did so for the last episode.</p>
