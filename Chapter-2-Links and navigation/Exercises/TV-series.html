        <h2> <u>Overview of How I Met Your Mother</u> </h2>
    
    <div class="o">
        <p>How I Met Your Mother (often abbreviated as HIMYM) is an American <b>sitcom</b>, 
            created by <b>Craig Thomas</b> and <b>Carter Bays</b> for <b>CBS</b>. The series, 
            which aired from September 19, 2005, to March 31, 2014, follows the main character, 
            <b>Ted Mosby</b>, and his group of friends in <b>New York City's Manhattan</b>. As a 
            framing device, Ted, in 2030, recounts to his son, Luke, and daughter, 
            Penny, the events from September 2005 to May 2013 that led him to <b>meet 
            their mother</b>. <i>How I Met Your Mother</i> was a joint production by Bays & 
            Thomas Productions and <b>20th Century Fox Television</b>, and syndicated by 
            <b>20th Television</b>.<br> 
            <br>The series was loosely inspired by Thomas and Bays' friendship when they both lived
            in New York. The vast majority of the episodes were directed by 
            <b>Pamela Fryman</b>. The other directors were <b>Rob Greenberg</b>, <b>Michael Shea</b>, and 
            <b>Neil Patrick Harris</b>.</p>

        <h2> <u>Production</u> </h2>
    
    <div class="s">
        <p><i>How I Met Your Mother</i> was inspired by Carter Bays and Craig Thomas' idea to "write about our 
            friends and the stupid stuff we did in New York", where they previously worked as writers for 
            <b>Late Show with David Letterman</b>, among others. The two drew from their friendship in 
            creating the characters. Ted is based loosely on Bays, and Marshall and Lily are based loosely 
            on Thomas and his wife. Thomas' wife Rebecca was initially reluctant to have a character based on 
            her but agreed if they could get <b>Alyson Hannigan</b> to play her. Hannigan was looking to do more 
            comedy work and was available. <b>Josh Radnor</b> and <b>Jason Segel</b>, who were cast as Ted and 
            Marshall, respectively, were not well known, although Segel had been a cast member on the short-lived 
            <b>Freaks and Geeks</b> and a recurring guest star on <b>Judd Apatow's</b> follow-up show, <b>Undeclared</b>. 
            The role of Barney was initially envisioned as a "<b>John Belushi-type character</b>" before <b>Neil Patrick 
            Harris</b> won the role after being invited to an audition by the show's casting director Megan Branman.
            <b>Pamela Fryman</b> invited <b>Bob Saget</b> to be the voiceover narrator, Future Ted, explaining to him 
            that the show would be like <b>The Wonder Years</b> but "kind of into the future". Saget either went to the 
            television studio and recorded the narration while watching the episode, or did so separately and rerecorded 
            with the episode if necessary. He normally did not attend <b>table readings</b> but did so for the last episode.</p>

        <h2> <u>Reviews of How I Met Your Mother</u> </h2>

    <div class="rw">
        <h3> <u>⭐ 8/10 Really Funny!</h3></u>
        <p> How I Met Your Mother will go down as one of the better comedies of all-time (and rightfully so) but there's no doubt as to who's the 
            best part of the show and that's Neil Patrick Harris (Barney)! He steals every scene that he's in and is funny in just about every 
            episode. The entire main cast (Harris, Josh Radnor, Jason Segal, Cobie Smuthers and Alyson Hannigan) is great which makes this show so 
            funny. The first season isn't as good so you may have to power through it out it's well worth it. Also, as most have already said...it 
            has one of the worst finales to a show in the history of television! If for some reason you're one of the few people who haven't seen 
            this yet then I highly recommend you do. It's almost impossible not to smile and have a good time during this show.</p>

        <h3> <u>⭐ 9/10 Will be remembered for it's wit, charm, one liners, slaps, and the bro code, not for it's bad ending.</u></h3>

        <h3> <u>⭐ 8/10 Neil Patrick Harris is great here!</u></h3>

        <h3> <u>⭐ 10/10 Beautiful!</u></h3>
        <p> Such a beautiful, funny, heart-warming & interesting show to watch! The characters are GREAT, their relationships so intriguing, love every 
            sub plot, 10/10!</p>

        <h3> <u>⭐ 10/10 Legen...wait for it...dary!</u></h3>
        <p> Hands down the best show I've ever watched. The gang are simply amazing. You can't help but love each single character. The plot has been 
            flawless even though I'd have loved a better ending but I believe it's the most sensible one since they had to shoot it after season 2 so 
            that the kids don't look older 7 years later. The writers have done such a great job and The fact that they've covered every single detail 
            in the show makes it terrific.</p>
