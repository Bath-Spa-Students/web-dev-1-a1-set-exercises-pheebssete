            framing device, Ted, in 2030, recounts to his son, Luke, and daughter, 
            Penny, the events from September 2005 to May 2013 that led him to <b>meet 
            their mother</b>. <i>How I Met Your Mother</i> was a joint production by Bays &

        <h2> <u>Reviews of How I Met Your Mother</u> </h2>

    <div id="reviews" class="rw">
        <h3> <u>⭐ 8/10 Really Funny!</h3></u>
        <p> How I Met Your Mother will go down as one of the better comedies of all-time (and rightfully so) but there's no doubt as to who's the 
            best part of the show and that's Neil Patrick Harris (Barney)! He steals every scene that he's in and is funny in just about every 
            episode. The entire main cast (Harris, Josh Radnor, Jason Segal, Cobie Smuthers and Alyson Hannigan) is great which makes this show so 
            funny. The first season isn't as good so you may have to power through it out it's well worth it. Also, as most have already said...it 
            has one of the worst finales to a show in the history of television! If for some reason you're one of the few people who haven't seen 
            this yet then I highly recommend you do. It's almost impossible not to smile and have a good time during this show.</p>

        <h3> <u>⭐ 9/10 Will be remembered for it's wit, charm, one liners, slaps, and the bro code, not for it's bad ending.</u></h3>

        <h3> <u>⭐ 8/10 Neil Patrick Harris is great here!</u></h3>

        <h3> <u>⭐ 10/10 Beautiful!</u></h3>
        <p> Such a beautiful, funny, heart-warming & interesting show to watch! The characters are GREAT, their relationships so intriguing, love every 
            sub plot, 10/10!</p>

        <h3> <u>⭐ 10/10 Legen...wait for it...dary!</u></h3>
        <p> Hands down the best show I've ever watched. The gang are simply amazing. You can't help but love each single character. The plot has been 
            flawless even though I'd have loved a better ending but I believe it's the most sensible one since they had to shoot it after season 2 so 
            that the kids don't look older 7 years later. The writers have done such a great job and The fact that they've covered every single detail 
            in the show makes it terrific.</p>
